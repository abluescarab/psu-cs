// *************
// PART 1: Lists
// *************

// We're going to be using a lot of recursive tree types in this course, so our
// first task in this assignment is to warm up with a simpler recursive type, a
// singly-linked list of numbers.

// TypeScript does not require the function and type definitions in a file to be
// in any particular order, so List's definition is able to reference ConsCell
// even though it's defined below List. List and ConsCell are **mutually recursive**:
// together they form a recursive singly-linked list data structure.

// The | operator in types means "or": a List is **either** the null value
// **or** a ConsCell value. In TypeScript, we have to be explicit about where
// null values are possible. We will use null to represent an empty list.
export type List = null | ConsCell;

// This style of type definition is very similar to a struct or class in many
// languages, and the way we use it here is almost identical to Python's "named
// tuples". A ConsCell object has a field named "first" that contains a
// (floating-point) number and a field named "rest" that contains another List.
export type ConsCell = {
  readonly first: number;
  readonly rest: List;
}

// (If you're wondering, the term "cons cell" is traditional functional
// programming terminology for this simple little data structure that represents
// a single "node" in a linked list. The name "cons" historically comes from the
// word "construct", but predates the modern OOP term "constructor".)

// Importantly, both of the fields of a ConsCell are marked readonly, which
// means they cannot be modified after a ConsCell object has been constructed.
// This means our List type is *immutable*: the contents of a List cannot be
// changed after its creation. This may seem odd, depending on your background
// in programming, but we have good reasons for doing this.

// Much of the work we do in this course (and in the field of PL) will carefully
// avoid modifying the data structures that our functions take as input, because
// we may reuse those same data structures in different ways later. Making the
// fields of our "node" types readonly helps ensure that we're doing this
// correctly, and opens up additional ways for the compiler and interpreter to
// automatically make our code run faster.

// TypeScript is a very modern *garbage-collected* language, which means we're
// free to allocate a lot of small objects and trust the garbage collector to
// deal with the cleanup, as long as we're not allocating huge amounts of small
// objects per second. Working with immutable data structures does lead us to do
// a lot of allocations, but it works out fine on the scale that we're concerned
// with in this course, and the optimizations can outweigh the performance costs.


// Let's see how to construct a sample List value by hand. The sampleList
// function below is written as a function so that you can add any test code you
// want to it and drop a breakpoint in it to watch your test code run: whenever
// you click the sampleList button on the assignment page, this sampleList
// function will execute.

// To define a function in TypeScript, we can use the "function" keyword along
// with notation similar to traditional C-like languages, except that the return
// type of the function is written **after** the argument list, separated by a
// colon.
export function sampleList(): List {
  // Mutable variable declarations in TypeScript are written with the "let"
  // keyword, and the type is written **after** the variable name, separated by
  // a colon.
  let list1: List = null;

  // To construct a ConsCell, we can use an *object literal*: the fields are
  // initialized between a pair of curly braces. We use the old null value of
  // list1 as the value in "rest" field, which gives us a single-element list.
  list1 = { first: 6, rest: list1 };

  // Immutable variable declarations in TypeScript are written with the "const"
  // keyword, and otherwise have the same notation as mutable declarations. If
  // you're used to Java, these are like "final" variables.
  const list2: List = { first: 5, rest: list1 };

  // We can nest object literal notation to define multiple nodes of a list.
  const list3: List = {
    first: 4,
    rest: {
      first: 3,
      rest: {
        first: 2,
        rest: list2
      }
    }
  };

  // Finally, we can return an object literal without giving it a name. Object
  // literal syntax is *first-class*: we can use it anywhere that we could use a
  // variable containing an object of the same type.
  return { first: 1, rest: list3 };
};


// For convenience, here is the traditional "cons" function that adds one "cons
// cell" to the front of a list. Arguments in a TypeScript function are written
// similarly to variable declarations, but without the "let" or "const" keyword.
export function cons(newFirst: number, list: List): List {
  return {
    first: newFirst,
    rest: list
  };
}

// Note that in the cons function, we **do not modify the input list**: instead,
// we return a **new** list that references the original list. This leaves the
// original list usable for other things outside of the cons function call.


// Here's our first function that does some actual computation with a List: The
// listToString function below is used in generating the string representations
// of lists that you see in the outputs on the assignment page.
export function listToString(list: List): string {
  // We start with a mutable string initialized to the empty string.
  let output: string = "";

  // A for loop can also be written very similar to in a C-like language.
  for (let cur: List = list; cur != null; cur = cur.rest) {
    // We can access the fields of an object with traditional "dot notation".
    // Number values have a .toString method for converting to string.
    // The += operator appends one string to another.
    output += cur.first.toString();

    // If there's a next element, we want a comma between this element and the
    // next element.
    if (cur.rest != null)
      output += ", ";
  }

  // Finally, we return the output string.
  return output;
}


// The technique of recursion will be very important to us in this course: while
// it will never be **strictly** necessary, it will be the **easiest** way to
// solve many of the problems we encounter.

// The traditional "snoc" function ("cons" backwards) recursively traverses a
// list in order to append a new element to the **end** of the list. Study this
// function carefully, and step through it in the debugger while watching the
// call stack.  This is an example of how we usually compute with immutable data
// structures.
export function snoc(newLast: number, list: List): List {
  if (list == null) {
    // If the input list is empty, then putting newLast at the "end" of it just
    // means returning a single-element list containing newLast. A
    // single-element list is a non-null list with a null "rest" field.
    return {
        first: newLast,
        rest: null
    };
  } else {
    // If the input list is nonempty, the output list should have the same first
    // element as the input list, and the rest of the output list should be the
    // rest of the input list with newLast appended at the end.
    const newRest: List = snoc(newLast, list.rest);
    return {
        first: list.first,
        rest: newRest
    };
  }
}


// For a point of comparison, let's see one function written both iteratively
// (with loops) and recursively. Below, the doubleEeachIterative and
// doubleEachRecursive functions each compute the same result: the output list
// is the same as the input list, but with each list element multiplied by 2.

export function doubleEachIterative(list: List): List {
  let output: List = null;

  // With a loop, we traverse the list left-to-right.
  for (let cur: List = list; cur != null; cur = cur.rest) {
    // To construct an output list in the same order, we need to append each
    // element to the **end** of the output list with snoc: we construct the
    // list right-to-left, in the **opposite** order that we traverse the input
    // list.
    output = snoc(cur.first * 2, output);
  }

  return output;
}

export function doubleEachRecursive(list: List): List {
  if (list == null) {
    return list;
  } else {
    // With recursion, we traverse left-to-right **and** construct the list
    // left-to-right with cons. This turns out to be very convenient when our
    // recursive data structures get more complicated than singly-linked lists.

    return cons(list.first * 2, doubledRest);

// PART 2: Trees
// *************

// Now, let's see our first example of the kind of *trees* that we'll work with
// in this course. The LogicTree type below is a type of *abstract syntax trees*
// (ASTs) for a tiny language of Boolean logic.

// A LogicTree is either an AndNode or a NotNode or a BoolLeaf.

  // node it is. This allows us to write switch/case statements over LogicTree
  // values based on their tags, as we'll see below.

  // Note that "and" is the *type* of this field. This means that in an AndNode
  // value, the "tag" field must always be the exact literal string "and"; it
  // can't be any other string. This is important to TypeScript's type system.
  readonly tag: "and";

  // An AndNode has two LogicTree subtrees, to represent the left and right
  // operand in the "AND" operation. Each subtree can be an AndNode or a NotNode
  // or a BoolLeaf.
  readonly leftSubtree: LogicTree;
  readonly rightSubtree: LogicTree;
}

// A NotNode represents a use of the Boolean "NOT" operator, which is written as
// "!" in the notation of our LogicTree language on the assignment page.
export type NotNode = {
  readonly tag: "not";

  // A NotNode only has a single LogicTree subtree, because the "NOT" operation
  // only applies to a single operand.
