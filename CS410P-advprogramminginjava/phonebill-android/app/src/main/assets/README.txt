Project: Phone Bill Web
Name:    Alana Gilston

This project implements a phone bill application that stores a number of phone calls with caller and callee numbers as well as start and end times.

The app will open with a view of all phone bills by customer name. To access a specific customer's bill, tap their name; to add a new customer, tap the button in the bottom right of the screen. After selecting a customer, the app will display a list of all phone calls added to that bill. To add a new phone call to the bill, tap the button in the bottom right of the screen.

From the main screen, tap the search icon marked with a magnifying glass to search all customer names; after tapping on a customer name, the search button will open the search interface to find individual phone calls within that bill.
